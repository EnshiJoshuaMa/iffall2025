                    <p>Bears are carnivoran mammals of the family Ursidae. They are classified as caniforms, or doglike
                        carnivorans. Although only eight species of bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing in
                        a wide variety of habitats throughout most of the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the
                        Southern Hemisphere. Bears are found on the continents of North America, South America, Europe,
                        and Asia. Common characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky legs, long
                        snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair, plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws, and
                        short tails.</p>

                    <p>Ailuropodinae is a subfamily of Ursidae that contains only one extant species, the giant panda
                        (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) of China. The fossil record of this group has shown that various
                        species of pandas were more widespread across the Holarctic, with species found in places such
                        as Europe, much of Asia, North America and even Africa. The giant panda is the most herbivorous
                        living bear species and has had an omnivorous diet that by around 2.4 million years ago, pandas
                        had evolved to be more herbivorous. The giant panda (Ailuropoda) belongs to the order of
                        Carnivora, this means that the macronutrients that are digested are most similar to those of
                        carnivores than to that of herbivores even though their diet consists mainly of bamboo.</p>

                    <p>The Tremarctinae or short-faced bears is a subfamily of Ursidae that contains one living
                        representative, the spectacled bear (Tremarctos ornatus) of South America, and several extinct
                        species from four genera: the Florida spectacled bear (Tremarctos floridanus), the North
                        American giant short-faced bear (Arctodus simus), the South American giant short-faced bear
                        (Arctotherium) and A. angustidens. A. vetustus, A. bonariense, A. wingei, and A. tarijense) as
                        well as Plionarctos (P. edensis and P. harroldorum), which is thought to be ancestral to the
                        other three genera. Of these, the giant short-faced bears (Arctodus simus and Arctotherium
                        angustiden) may have been the largest ever carnivorans in the Americas. The group is thought to
                        have originated around 5 million years ago and then invaded South America as part of the Great
                        American Interchange. Most short-faced bears became extinct at the end of the Pleistocene.</p>
