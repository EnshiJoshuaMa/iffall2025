        <ol type = "1">
            <li>Joshua Ma, Communication Design, Junior</li>
            <li>I am taking this class because it is a core requirement for my major.</li>
            <li>I have almost no experience with HTML, CSS, and JS. I have only used it sparlingly last semester to typeset a chapbook.</li>
            <li>I hope to learn how to create web components that are visually responsive to user input in a compelling way.</li>
            <li>I expect to have less agency over the way a user experiences the work while designing for the screen. Typically, when designing for paper, the designer has the privilege of deciding the exact format of engagement, such as the dimensions of a book or the the way a user flips through its pages. On screen, users have unique relationships with their devices; and these differing relationships determine how the user engages or processes a piece of design.</li>
            <li><a href="https://torinodesign.info/en/">Torinodesign</a> is an effectively designed website, in my opinion. Although there aren't any flashy visual moves that the designers of the website made, it still serves its purpose robustly. THe website is an indiscriminate list of design studios based in Piedmont, Italy. By presenting these design studios in a purely alphabetical order, the catalogue offers exposure to design studios, small and large, in a very democratic manner. Unlike the results you would get in a google search, this list shows lesser-known studios alongside big-name corporations. The design is effective in its ability to give smaller studios a chance to compete in a industry where being known is almost too important.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.itsnicethat.com/">Itsnicethat</a> is an example of a clear communicating website. I especially appreciate the way that the desigers display each individual article on the home page in vertical columns. The images for each article offer a helpful preview to the content, and the small tags beneath each title are a great way to tell the reader whether or not they might be interested in the discussed topic.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.getty.edu/tracingart/">getty.edu/tracingart</a> is a website that works well. The screen does not appear to be too cluttered for the vast amount of information that it aims to present. The instructions on how to engage with the site are clear without being too distracting. In general, this site offers a calm browsing experience along with engaging storytelling.</li>
